What qualities of a wine will boost its review score? 

### Key Question:
Determine which features of wines are predictors of getting great reviews to help businesses
improve their reputation by identifying higher quality wine, and in turn increase wine sales.

### Abstract:
There are so many different types of wine, but what helps differentiate a great wine from a good
wine? We picked this question based on the assumption that a great wine score (given by a
reviewer) will drive higher sales. We want to help wine businesses at many points in the supply
chain, and we are interested in discovering which qualities of a wine lead to higher scores. This
information will help businesses decide which types of wines to invest in. To investigate this, our
team looked into a dataset that contained data on more than 120,000 wines. It contained
information such as the description, score, price, country, province, region, taster, year, and
variety. Through our analysis, we came up with several strategies to improve wine review scores.
